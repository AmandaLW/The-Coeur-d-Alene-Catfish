	\section{Introduction}
	
		\subsection{Goal}
		Autonomous navigation and sampling of lake sediment in North Idaho lakes up to 1200 feet in depth. Project is being operated in cooperation with Gizmo and CDA Maker Space
	
		\subsection{Project Summary}
		The western region of the United States has been home to expensive mining operations, and there is an abundance of abandoned hard rock mines that fill this landscape. These mines contain dangerous toxins that contaminate nearby soils and water. Thus a large portion of headwater streams in the Western United States have been effected by this. These toxins and metals can be transmitted to lake basins, which can become repositories for a large quantity of sediment associated metals. Coeur d'Alene lake in Northern Idaho, where silver and lead mining in the South fork of Coeur d'Alene River has carried heavy metal contaminated sediments to the lakebed. Thus in Coeur d'Alene lake this is a prominent issue, and while these issues are apparent there, it is not just this lake that has this problem. Legacy Contamination within river beads is a problem on an international scale. Computer models also do not provide an accurate characterization of the transport of contamination, a more direct sensing of contamination is required. This is where the research for this project comes into play, to develop the Coeur d'Alene Catfish, which is an autonomous robotic drone that is capable of reading water quality information from Coeur d'Alene lake, and other deep water lakes. The end result then should be the development (key word is development, not completion) of a submarine that can provide autonomous deployment within Coeur d'Alene lake and other deep water lakes. Reservoirs are also desired as well, which can be fairly difficult to navigate due to the problematic kinetic nature of the environment. This in turn allows public to the supervision of water bodies in local communities as well. The results from such surveys conducted by the drone will be shared with other interested stakeholders, this will include the Idaho Water Department of Environmental Quality (IDEQ) and Coeur d'Alene Tribe.\\
		The research focuses on creating and/or starting beginning development into the infrastructure of an autonomous submarine (and sensor technologies). Thus the long term goal is a fully functional autonomous submarine that can collect water quality data in deep-water lakes and reservoirs. The short term goal is to develop the "CDA Catfish", submarine that can perform underwater surveys by continuously sampling a variety of water quality variables (oxygen, pH, temperature, etc).\\
		Interested parties/sponsors for pursuing this research include the Idaho Water Resource Research Institute, the United States Geologic Survey, and the University of Idaho. The research is also in cooperation with Gizmo, Coeur d'Alene Maker Space.\\

		\subsection{7/10/2018 Team Meeting 5 Notes}
			
			\noindent
			Adrian and Samantha present at 9:26 am, the meeting was held in the classroom at the Innovation Den, Dr. Shoivc arrived at 9:29 am. Meeting attire was required to be professional/formal, thus both teammates wore appropriate attire. Meeting agendas were printed out beforehand to keep the meeting organized and structured.
			
			\noindent
			The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the large list of prior achievements we accomplished, such as the software controlling checking, thruster overloading fix, operations manual completion, etc. Other included talking about the access point needed for Arduino, current for the Pi, a software timer for the Pi to Arduino, the boat launch, another dock launch, the July 26th launch, and moving forward with the project.
			
			\noindent
			Meeting began at 9:29 am, everyone present, with printed meeting agendas for everyone:
			
			\noindent
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Meeting Time?
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Ends at 11:00 am
					\item There is a long meeting to go through
				\end{itemize}
				\item Operations Manual
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Turn instructions into a series of checklists 
					\item Fix/edit some issues that have been fixed now in the software
				\end{itemize}
				\item Access Point
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Works on Jesse, but doesn't work on Stretch
					\item MQTT Message Transmission --> can't load Mosquito on the Access Point Raspberry Pi
					\item Access Point battery questions: 5V? Battery concerns? Wattage?
				\end{itemize}
				\item Reading Current from Pi
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Add that device later down the line
					\item Fall time-line
				\end{itemize}
				\item Pi to Arduino
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Software timer
					\begin{itemize}
						\item If Arduino gets no command
