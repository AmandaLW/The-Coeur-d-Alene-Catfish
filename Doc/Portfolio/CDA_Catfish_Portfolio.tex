	\section{Introduction}
	
		\subsection{Goal}
		Autonomous navigation and sampling of lake sediment in North Idaho lakes up to 1200 feet in depth. Project is being operated in cooperation with Gizmo and CDA Maker Space
	
		\subsection{Project Summary}
		The western region of the United States has been home to expensive mining operations, and there is an abundance of abandoned hard rock mines that fill this landscape. These mines contain dangerous toxins that contaminate nearby soils and water. Thus a large portion of headwater streams in the Western United States have been effected by this. These toxins and metals can be transmitted to lake basins, which can become repositories for a large quantity of sediment associated metals. Coeur d'Alene lake in Northern Idaho, where silver and lead mining in the South fork of Coeur d'Alene River has carried heavy metal contaminated sediments to the lakebed. Thus in Coeur d'Alene lake this is a prominent issue, and while these issues are apparent there, it is not just this lake that has this problem. Legacy Contamination within river beads is a problem on an international scale. Computer models also do not provide an accurate characterization of the transport of contamination, a more direct sensing of contamination is required. This is where the research for this project comes into play, to develop the Coeur d'Alene Catfish, which is an autonomous robotic drone that is capable of reading water quality information from Coeur d'Alene lake, and other deep water lakes. The end result then should be the development (key word is development, not completion) of a submarine that can provide autonomous deployment within Coeur d'Alene lake and other deep water lakes. Reservoirs are also desired as well, which can be fairly difficult to navigate due to the problematic kinetic nature of the environment. This in turn allows public to the supervision of water bodies in local communities as well. The results from such surveys conducted by the drone will be shared with other interested stakeholders, this will include the Idaho Water Department of Environmental Quality (IDEQ) and Coeur d'Alene Tribe.\\
		The research focuses on creating and/or starting beginning development into the infrastructure of an autonomous submarine (and sensor technologies). Thus the long term goal is a fully functional autonomous submarine that can collect water quality data in deep-water lakes and reservoirs. The short term goal is to develop the "CDA Catfish", submarine that can perform underwater surveys by continuously sampling a variety of water quality variables (oxygen, pH, temperature, etc).\\
		Interested parties/sponsors for pursuing this research include the Idaho Water Resource Research Institute, the United States Geologic Survey, and the University of Idaho. The research is also in cooperation with Gizmo, Coeur d'Alene Maker Space.\\

		\subsection{Definition of Terms}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{G2X} - A remotely operated underwater vehicle developed by Gizmo-cda, a makerspace located in Coeur d'Alene Idaho. The vehicle itself operates with 5 thrusters, with a Raspberry Pi (Model 3) as the SBC (Single Board Controller), alongside additional components. Components are located within the navigation module of the G2X. The vehicle can be operated via a controller (using the Pygame Python library and a Playstation 4 Controller), requiring a tether (handling gear) to provide the input, or can be run autonomously with a program, running on the G2X's Raspberry P (no tether), or a host computer (tether required). Operational Time is 6 hours on full charge, thrusters and raspberry pi operate on separate batteries, 8 hours for Pi, 6 hours for thrusters.Software for operating the software is provided courtesy of Gizmo, located at \url{https://github.com/gizmo-cda/g2x-submarine-v2}
				\item \textbf{Navigation Module} - Module located within the G2X that houses the the primary components of the vehicle, components are a Raspberry Pi 3, PiSenseHat (sensor module that includes internal pressure, temperature, compass, accelerometer, and gyroscope readings), a PWM Hat (for handling the PWM thrusters), an Arduino Nano for reading voltage, 5 Electronic Speed Controllers (ESC), a power regulator, pressure, temperature sensor for external treadings, and a Pi Camera V2 NoIR (video streaming).
				\item \textbf{ROS} - Robot Operating System. It is a robotics middle collection of software frameworks for robot software development.

It is a ROS Library that implements a 3D occupancy grid mapping approach providing data structures and mapping algorithms in C++. The map implementation is based on an octree (tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly eight children). \\
				(https://wiki.ros.org/octomap)
				\item \textbf{Moveit!} - A motion planning framework.It is a software framework for mobile manipulation, including utilizing advances in motion planning, manipulation, 3D perception, kinematics, control and navigation. Thus providing a simple platform for developing robotics applications.\\
				(https://moveit.ros.org/)
				\item \textbf{SLAM} - Simultaneous localization and mapping. SLAM is a computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it. There are several algorithms known for solving it (at least approximately).\\

		\subsubsection{ROS - Additional Info}
		The Robot Operating System contains many essential features, including: hardware abstraction, low-level device control, message-passing between processes, and package management. ROS nodes are written in either C++ or Python. ROS is primarily supported on Ubuntu Linux, with other major OS being designated as "Experimental". The underwater research project will be using ROS Kinetic Kame (2016) as its ROS version, due to its supported features and stability.
